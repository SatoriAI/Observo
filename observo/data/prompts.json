You want to open this way, because you want to convey that, by supporting your proposal, the reviewers will be contributing to the goals of NSF-supported research (which are to create a solution with transformative impact potential, deep technological novelty, clear customer pull, and the capacity to scale and reshape an industry). For example, were you writing an application about a biochemical defect you suspect is the cause of manic depressive ill-ness, you wouldn't want your first sentence to focus on the fundamental biochemistry. In-stead, you would want to open with a sentence that makes clear how important manic depression is in this country, both from the standpoint of numbers of people affected and the cost of caring for such persons.

Save the details for later.\r\n\r\nYour current task is to write the ”2.3. Needs Statement” of this proposal.\r\n\r\nA needs statement is formed by combining the objective and the rationale. ‘We need to do thus and so, because once we have the new knowledge, we can .........’\r\n\r\nMost grant proposals that focus on infrastructure, methods development, implementation science, outcomes research, or other “product-driven” efforts are need-driven rather than hypothesis-driven. In such applications, a formal hypothesis would be artificial; instead, the reviewers must see a clear, compelling need whose satisfaction will directly fulfill the project’s objective. The needs statement plays the same anchoring role for a need-driven proposal that the central hypothesis plays for a hypothesis-driven one:\r\n- Logical flow from the Objective. Just as a hypothesis flows from (and, when tested, attains) the objective, the need you identify must flow from—and, when met, complete—the objective. Stating the need succinctly shows reviewers exactly why the work must be done and what gap will be closed when it is finished.\r\n- Directional focus and scope. A persuasive needs statement is specific and actionable, not a vague wish list. It eliminates any sense that you plan to “look around and see what might be useful”; instead, it tells reviewers precisely which gap you will close (e.g., absence of validated biomarkers, lack of scalable assay, missing community resource) and who or what will benefit once it is filled.\r\n- Objectively document the gap. Although a needs statement is not “testable” in the experimental sense, it must still rest on objective evidence, not opinion. Use epidemiologic data, unmet-demand analyses, feasibility pilots, stakeholder surveys, or your own preliminary results to prove that the gap is real, important, and still unaddressed.\r\n- Facets that lead to Specific Aims. Break the overarching need into 2–4 discrete facets; each facet should map one-to-one onto a Specific Aim that will satisfy it. This assures reviewers that you have a concrete, stepwise plan to meet the need rather than a single monolithic task that could stall.\r\n- Avoiding contrivance and bias. Do not disguise a straightforward comparison (e.g., “Is treatment B better than A?”) as a hypothesis when it is fundamentally a question of need (“We need to determine whether B improves outcomes so patients can receive the best care”). Reviewers quickly recognize—and penalize—forced hypotheses.\r\n- Explain why this need is the priority. Immediately after stating the need, add a bullet explaining how you came to identify and prioritize it over other possible gaps. Emphasize the strength of your preliminary data, the clinical or public-health urgency, recommendations from advisory panels, or documented stakeholder demand. This tells reviewers your project is not arbitrary but the result of disciplined, evidence-based planning.\r\n\r\n⸻\r\n\r\nHow to write the Needs Statement section (two-bullet format):\r\n- First bullet — State the need itself.\r\nExample:\r\n“There is an urgent need for an open-access, cloud-deployable analytic pipeline that can process single-cell RNA-seq data from >1 million cells in under 24 hours; without such a resource, population-scale functional genomics studies remain impractical.”\r\n- Second bullet — Justify why this need is the logical starting point.\r\nExample:\r\n“We identified this need through (i) our preliminary benchmarking of current pipelines, which fail above 200 k cells; (ii) stakeholder interviews with 12 population-genetics consortia that cited data-processing bottlenecks as their top barrier; and (iii) recent literature indicating that upcoming NSF cohorts will generate datasets ≥10 million cells each.”\r\n\r\nFor logical flow, context for this aspect is provided below in the form of previously written sections:\r\n‘1.1.

The rationale should tell the reviewer what will become possible after the research is completed that is not possible now. That is why you are seeking the new knowledge. \"What will become possible\" has to link back to the problem that is described at the end of the first paragraph — the step in the field that is being prevented by the gap in the knowledge base. When the research has been completed, you will be able to take the step. In a nutshell, that is why you want to undertake the research. That is your rationale, therefore. A well-written rationale can be a very powerful means of engendering enthusiasm and advocacy for your proposal among reviewers, because the outcomes of the proposed research will clearly advance the field.\r\n\r\nAt this point, your reviewers will know what you want to do and, in a general sense, how you plan to do it.

It must be a reason that is appealing to NSF, i.e., one that applies to the development of a product with transformative impact potential, deep technological novelty, clear customer pull, and the capacity to scale and reshape an industry. The rationale is not a justification of why you have selected a specific disease or model for investigation. Nor can it be that the problem you have selected is an interesting one that is worthy of study. Rather, as mentioned earlier, it must tell the reviewers what will become possible after the research has been completed that is not possible now. It must pass that litmus test!

Well-Prepared and Research Environment” of this proposal.\r\n\r\nYou should end the second paragraph by conveying why you and your colleagues are better prepared than other, equally qualified investigators. This component needs to tell the reviewers that you and your team have the competitive edge and that you will be working in a research environment that is conducive to success. This should not be a collection of routine biographical material and resources. It should be restricted to just that which distinguishes you from others. Most important among the things that you write here are your preliminary data.\r\n\r\nTwo of the criteria used to evaluate NSF grant applications are the qualifications of the investigators and their research environment. You need to address both of these points here. Why are you and your colleagues better prepared to address the problem that you have chosen than other, equally qualified investigators or companies? Occasionally, it will be because you have unique expertise or a reagent or technology that no one else has. If you are fortunate enough to be able to make such a claim, by all means, do so.\r\nHowever, most of the time you will have the competitive edge because of a composite of characteristics, no one of which is particularly unique by itself. Collectively, they set you and your group apart. Usually the quantity and quality of your preliminary data make the best case for why you are best prepared to undertake the proposed research; because of such data, you have a running start. Therefore, begin writing the section below with one that tells the reviewer specifically what makes your preliminary data strong and/or novel. Continue with additional, complementary bullets, e.g., such things as the combined expertise of your research team (e.g., basic and clinical researchers working together to provide the entire spe-trum of expertise necessary to obtain a definitive outcome) or extensive experience with a demanding model. Conclude with a bullet or two about your research environment and why it is particularly supportive of the kinds of research that will be performed. This may be because of essential core facilities, provision of skilled technical support by the institution, or because you are surrounded by colleagues/employees who have complementary research interests (i.e., other investigators with whom to discuss and evaluate your data). Be specific with all of your bullets here! Avoid the temptation of indulging in clichés (e.g., state-of-the-art equipment) and empty generalities (e.g., Dr. X is an outstanding molecular biologist).\r\n\r\n\r\nFor logical flow, context for this aspect is provided below in the form of previously written sections:\r\n‘1.1.

To avoid that trap, think of this section as an executive summary of the application that is meant to project mainly the conceptual, i.e., the most exciting aspects of your application. Save the details for later.\r\n\r\nYour current task is to write the ”3. Specific Aims” of this proposal.\r\n\r\nYour specific aims are presented in this paragraph. They are the means that you will use to test your needs statement. Therefore, with respect to linkage, your aims must grow out of, and be completely concordant with, your needs statement. Your specific aims should be written as exciting, brief, conceptual 'headlines,' not as long, technically detailed descriptions of what will be done. Your aims should tell the reviewers 'why' you want to do what you are proposing, not 'what' you propose to do. Thus, a well-written aim is usually the answer to the question, \"Why do I want to do this?\"\r\n\r\nNow it's time to write your specific aims. They are probably the most difficult components of the section to write. Because of this fact, we will review for you some of the most important points that were made earlier and provide you with some additional examples. As you will remember, your aims must clearly grow out of your needs statement, because they are the means by which you will test that needs statement. They need to be brief, informative, attention-getting 'headlines' that will attract a reviewer's attention and whet his/her interest. Under no circumstance should your aims be descriptive, i.e., project what is best referred to as 'look-and-see' research (I will do X, determine what happens, and then describe the outcome). For that reason, you should avoid the use of words in your aims that connote a descriptive approach, such as (but not limited to) compare, correlate, de-scribe, catalog, investigate or define. Neither should the aims project technical aspects of the testing process, i.e., they should not be 'how to' statements. What you want to project is the 'why' — conceptually, why am I including this aim? The best way to write strong, exciting aims is to ensure that each is driven by an hypothesis that is subordinate to your central hypothesis. This approach will minimize the likelihood that your aims will either be descriptive or viewed as a fishing expedition. 'Identify the mechanism that is responsible for initiating macrophage activation.' is an example of an aim that is written at a general level. The working hypothesis for that aim, which would follow it as a brief, subordinate paragraph, might be something like, 'The working hypothesis for this aim, based on preliminary data that will be presented later (Preliminary Studies) is that binding of IFN-y to its receptor activates STAT-1a, which then, together with other transcription factors, up-regulates the expression of genes that would otherwise be silent.' The generally written aim has conveyed that the applicant will identify the mechanism, regardless of what it turns out to be. By then narrowing the focus of the research to a specific entity with a working hypothesis, the applicant avoids writing an aim that is unfocused and open-ended. The trap of writing an aim like, 'Determine whether STAT-la initiates macrophage activation.' has also been avoided. With an aim like that, if it actually is STAT-la, the applicant is in great shape; however, if it's not, the applicant (and the reviewer) is left with nothing. Note how the 'general aim/narrow working hypothesis' approach also avoids the trap of proposing a 'fishing expedition,' wherein a laundry list of mechanisms is presented, each of which would be investigated in an effort to find the correct one.\r\nThe aims you present must fully test your central hypothesis, nothing more and nothing less. Ideally, each aim should be seen as testing a specific 'facet' of your central hypothesis. If an aim isn't clearly related to testing some aspect of the central hypothesis, it will be rejected by the reviewers as unnecessary.\r\nTwo-to-five aims are needed (we prefer two-to-three). The page limitation precludes your ability to develop any more aims than five substantively. Each aim should be approximately equal with respect to the amount of work it will entail and the importance it has to the project. The first aim must flow logically into the second, and so on; however, none can be absolutely dependent on an expected outcome of an earlier aim. Why? Because, in such a circumstance, should the critical aim either not be achieved or its outcome would turn out to be different than expected, the subsequent, dependent aims) could not be pursued as proposed. For example, consider an application on gene regulation that has as its first specific aim, 'Clone the promoter for gene X' Examination of the subsequent aims reveals that all of them build on the expectation that the promoter will be available. Such an application would be fundamentally and fatally flawed, because, if the promoter couldn't be cloned, the rest of the work couldn't be done. The applicant should have realized that fact and cloned the promoter as part of his/her preliminary studies.\r\nUsing these tips, write the Specific Aims Paragraph focusing on the aims and the respective need statement for each aim.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor logical flow, context for this aspect is provided below in the form of previously written sections:\r\n‘1.1.

As an assistant, you support a technology startup in the grant application process for a Phase I SBIR project. Your task is to write the ”4.3. Impact.” aspect of the Specific Aims section of a proposal for {{ name }}, write it out in bullet points specified below.\r\n\r\nThe Specific Aims section must be something that can be read and understood easily and quickly. The flow of logic must be unassailable and absolutely compelling, such that it leads the reviewers to a position of advocacy for your application — without their knowing that they have been led.\r\n\r\nEach of the thirteen components of the Specific Aims section has to be linked logically to what comes before it and to what comes after it.

Save the details for later.\r\n\r\nYour current task is to write the ”4.3. Impact” of this proposal.\r\n\r\nThese final sentences are difficult to write, because they must succinctly summarize what comes next, in the 'significance' paragraph of your Background and Significance section. The danger is that you can create redundancy if this is not written well. The ideal approach is to make these sentences the segue - the bridge or transition - that will carry you into the significance paragraph. Tip: write the impact statement at a general level (this is the one place in the application where you need to write generally, rather than specifically). After you have written this statement, ask, 'Does what I have written generally convey to the reviewer what the impact of the expected new knowledge will be, once it has been applied?' You will use the significance paragraph to substantiate the generalization about impact with which you end the Specific Aims section. Linkage: the impact that you expect should include full or, at least partial, solution of the important problem that you delineated in the first paragraph. At the same time, your impact statement should make clear that the outcomes will advance your field vertically.\r\n\r\nConclude the fourth paragraph and your Specific Aims section by expanding the bullets that you wrote to summarize the general impact that your research will have. It might be similar to something like this, 'Collectively, these outcomes will establish the ß protein's role in transmembrane signaling by the IFN-y receptor complex. This is expected to positively affect human health, because it will allow the development of new pharmacologic strategies that are designed to augment host defense of the lung. At the same time, the fundamental new knowledge obtained about the interaction of protein subunits is expected to advance the general field of receptor biology’. Write your comparable sentences. Make sure that what you write sets up an easy transition into the next section, which will begin with your 'significance' paragraph. In that paragraph, you will detail and substantiate with specifics the relatively general statement about impact that you write here.\r\n\r\nFor logical flow, context for this aspect is provided below in the form of previously written sections:\r\n‘1.1.

By doing so, you will avoid tortuous, hard-to-understand, compound sentences that go on forever. When you want to use a comma and keep going, stop and ask yourself whether it would be more clear to use a period, instead.\r\nAvoid the use of clichés and 'empty generalities.' These are words and statements that, at first, look great, but when analyzed carefully, really convey little or nothing. For example avoid sentences like, 'The proposed state-of-the-art research is expected to advance the field significantly.' Another example to avoid: 'It is essential that we define the impact that drug X has on the intestine at the cellular and molecular levels.' 'Be specific!' is one of the cardinal rules of good grantsmanship. Specificity and precision are what build credibility with reviewers. Use of meaningless clichés and generalities does the opposite.\r\nThird, avoid the use of nouns as adjectives, which is a particularly prevalent problem among grant writers. Consider: 'lower respiratory tract iron burden' or 'total parenteral nutrition catheters.' What is actually meant in these two examples is 'burden of iron in the lower respiratory tract' and catheters for use in administering total parenteral nutrition,' respectively. It doesn't add that much more text to make things maximally clear. The gain in understanding is well worth it. As will be noted in detail later, the same comments can be made about the use of non-standard abbreviations. You don't gain that much space and you run the risk of suffering a major loss of comprehension.\r\nFourth, make sure that you avoid the use of 'weak' words, i.e., ones that convey doubt in your ability to do something. By weak words we mean ones like: if (if we are able to do X, then we can do T); try (we will try to overcome the problem that is caused by X); hope (we hope to obtain Y); believe (we believe [pray?] that we can); might (we might be able to prepare the antiserum); could/should (we could/should obtain); and may (we may be able to extend our understanding to). In every one of these examples, the word 'expect' could have been substituted (e.g., we expect to obtain, instead of we hope to obtain). Use of 'expect' is a much more positive and assured way of saying that you are going to give it your best shot, while still leaving open the possibility that you might not succeed.\r\nFifth, the word 'whether' can pose serious problems for the grant writer. Why? Because, although it is often used alone, it always means whether or [something else]. Often, it is whether or not. Just as in the case of weak words, this latter usage of 'whether' can cause doubt in the mind of a reviewer (What happens if it comes out 'not'?). The next time that you find yourself about to use 'whether [or not],' try 'the extent to which' as a substitute. \"Whether or not' is black-and-white, one way or the other. 'The extent to which' ranges from 0 to 100%. Thus, the use of this phrase can avoid the problem of 'not' (i.e., failure) being the alternative outcome."

Start with an overview sentence that depicts the 'forest' for your reviewers. For example, if you were writing your application about the receptor for interferon-v, you might begin with a sentence about the importance of the cytokine that binds to it: \"Interferon-y is a 'master' cytokine that has a broad range of both direct and indirect effects on cells, thereby allowing it to regulate a variety of normal functions, as well as to initiate some abnormal processes.\" The one-to-two sentences that follow should then rapidly narrow the reviewer's focus to what is 'state-of-the-art' knowledge about the specific subject of your applica-tion, i.e., the 'trees' on which you plan to focus. Continuing with the example of the receptor for IFN-y, the next two sentences might be something like, 'All of the effects that are attributable to IFN-y are mediated through a single receptor that is present on all nucleated cell types. Currently, it is known that this receptor consists of one binding protein, the a chain, which is constant species-to-species, and a second, B, chain that is species-specific.' Now, write your comparable, complete sentences\r\n/n/\r\n\r\nBullet point plan of individual aspects of the Specific Aims section.\r\n\r\nWarning 1!

Only use previous and following aspects of the proposal for improving the logical flow of the proposal aspect you are currently writing.\r\n\r\nWrite your answer following these 5 instruction points:\r\nWrite in clear, simple declarative sentences. By doing so, you will avoid tortuous, hard-to-understand, compound sentences that go on forever. When you want to use a comma and keep going, stop and ask yourself whether it would be more clear to use a period, instead.\r\nAvoid the use of clichés and 'empty generalities.' These are words and statements that, at first, look great, but when analyzed carefully, really convey little or nothing. For example avoid sentences like, 'The proposed state-of-the-art research is expected to advance the field significantly.' Another example to avoid: 'It is essential that we define the impact that drug X has on the intestine at the cellular and molecular levels.' 'Be specific!' is one of the cardinal rules of good grantsmanship. Specificity and precision are what build credibility with reviewers. Use of meaningless clichés and generalities does the opposite.\r\nThird, avoid the use of nouns as adjectives, which is a particularly prevalent problem among grant writers. Consider: 'lower respiratory tract iron burden' or 'total parenteral nutrition catheters.' What is actually meant in these two examples is 'burden of iron in the lower respiratory tract' and catheters for use in administering total parenteral nutrition,' respectively. It doesn't add that much more text to make things maximally clear. The gain in understanding is well worth it. As will be noted in detail later, the same comments can be made about the use of non-standard abbreviations. You don't gain that much space and you run the risk of suffering a major loss of comprehension.\r\nFourth, make sure that you avoid the use of 'weak' words, i.e., ones that convey doubt in your ability to do something. By weak words we mean ones like: if (if we are able to do X, then we can do T); try (we will try to overcome the problem that is caused by X); hope (we hope to obtain Y); believe (we believe [pray?] that we can); might (we might be able to prepare the antiserum); could/should (we could/should obtain); and may (we may be able to extend our understanding to). In every one of these examples, the word 'expect' could have been substituted (e.g., we expect to obtain, instead of we hope to obtain). Use of 'expect' is a much more positive and assured way of saying that you are going to give it your best shot, while still leaving open the possibility that you might not succeed.\r\nFifth, the word 'whether' can pose serious problems for the grant writer. Why? Because, although it is often used alone, it always means whether or [something else]. Often, it is whether or not. Just as in the case of weak words, this latter usage of 'whether' can cause doubt in the mind of a reviewer (What happens if it comes out 'not'?). The next time that you find yourself about to use 'whether [or not],' try 'the extent to which' as a substitute. \"Whether or not' is black-and-white, one way or the other. 'The extent to which' ranges from 0 to 100%. Thus, the use of this phrase can avoid the problem of 'not' (i.e., failure) being the alternative outcome."

Only use previous and following aspects of the proposal for improving the logical flow of the proposal aspect you are currently writing.\r\n\r\nWrite your answer following these 5 instruction points:\r\nWrite in clear, simple declarative sentences. By doing so, you will avoid tortuous, hard-to-understand, compound sentences that go on forever. When you want to use a comma and keep going, stop and ask yourself whether it would be more clear to use a period, instead.\r\nAvoid the use of clichés and 'empty generalities.' These are words and statements that, at first, look great, but when analyzed carefully, really convey little or nothing. For example avoid sentences like, 'The proposed state-of-the-art research is expected to advance the field significantly.' Another example to avoid: 'It is essential that we define the impact that drug X has on the intestine at the cellular and molecular levels.' 'Be specific!' is one of the cardinal rules of good grantsmanship. Specificity and precision are what build credibility with reviewers. Use of meaningless clichés and generalities does the opposite.\r\nThird, avoid the use of nouns as adjectives, which is a particularly prevalent problem among grant writers. Consider: 'lower respiratory tract iron burden' or 'total parenteral nutrition catheters.' What is actually meant in these two examples is 'burden of iron in the lower respiratory tract' and catheters for use in administering total parenteral nutrition,' respectively. It doesn't add that much more text to make things maximally clear. The gain in understanding is well worth it. As will be noted in detail later, the same comments can be made about the use of non-standard abbreviations. You don't gain that much space and you run the risk of suffering a major loss of comprehension.\r\nFourth, make sure that you avoid the use of 'weak' words, i.e., ones that convey doubt in your ability to do something. By weak words we mean ones like: if (if we are able to do X, then we can do T); try (we will try to overcome the problem that is caused by X); hope (we hope to obtain Y); believe (we believe [pray?] that we can); might (we might be able to prepare the antiserum); could/should (we could/should obtain); and may (we may be able to extend our understanding to). In every one of these examples, the word 'expect' could have been substituted (e.g., we expect to obtain, instead of we hope to obtain). Use of 'expect' is a much more positive and assured way of saying that you are going to give it your best shot, while still leaving open the possibility that you might not succeed.\r\nFifth, the word 'whether' can pose serious problems for the grant writer. Why? Because, although it is often used alone, it always means whether or [something else]. Often, it is whether or not. Just as in the case of weak words, this latter usage of 'whether' can cause doubt in the mind of a reviewer (What happens if it comes out 'not'?). The next time that you find yourself about to use 'whether [or not],' try 'the extent to which' as a substitute. \"Whether or not' is black-and-white, one way or the other. 'The extent to which' ranges from 0 to 100%. Thus, the use of this phrase can avoid the problem of 'not' (i.e., failure) being the alternative outcome."

Needs Statement” aspect of the proposal into a final version:\r\n/n/\r\nAfter drafting the two bullets that define (1) what need must be met and (2) why this need is the highest-priority starting point, you should expand them into the polished narrative that will appear in your proposal.\r\n\r\n⸻\r\n\r\n1  |  Start with a direct, stand-alone sentence that states the need\r\n\r\nTake the first bullet—your concise statement of the unmet gap—and convert it into a full sentence that begins your paragraph. Keep it directional and action-oriented (e.g., “There is an urgent need for …”) and make sure the link to your Objective is crystal-clear.\r\n\r\n[EXAMPLE] Draft bullet\r\n• “There is an urgent need for an open-access, cloud-deployable analytic pipeline that can process single-cell RNA-seq data from >1 million cells in under 24 hours.”\r\n\r\n[EXAMPLE] Expanded sentence\r\n“There is an urgent need for an open-access, cloud-deployable pipeline capable of processing single-cell RNA-seq data from more than one million cells within 24 hours; without such a resource, population-scale functional genomics remains impractical.”\r\n\r\n⸻\r\n\r\n2  |  Immediately anchor the need to its real-world impact\r\n\r\nAdd a short explanatory clause—or an entire second sentence—that makes the consequence of filling the gap unmistakable. This is the “so what?” moment that tells reviewers exactly who will benefit and how the field will advance.\r\n\r\n“…without such a resource, population-scale functional genomics remains impractical, delaying discovery of regulatory variants that drive complex disease.”\r\n\r\n⸻\r\n\r\n3  |  Fold in the justification you listed in the second bullet\r\n\r\nTransform the second bullet into one or two sentences that explain how you identified and validated this need. Reference your preliminary data, stakeholder input, literature benchmarks, or public-health statistics—whatever evidence you have marshalled. Phrase it the way you would speak to a reviewer: confident, but strictly factual.\r\n\r\n“We prioritized this need after (i) benchmarking seven widely used pipelines, none of which completed datasets above 200 k cells; (ii) interviewing 12 population-genomics consortia that ranked data-processing bottlenecks as their top barrier; and (iii) reviewing recent NIH calls for proposals that anticipate datasets exceeding 10 million cells.”\r\n\r\n⸻\r\n\r\n4  |  Show how the need decomposes into Specific Aims\r\n\r\nClose with a bridging sentence that maps the need’s key facets to your forthcoming Specific Aims. This reassures reviewers that every Aim is directly tied to eliminating the gap you have described—no “fishing expeditions.”\r\n\r\n“Therefore, Specific Aims 1–3 will (Aim 1) engineer a scalable, cloud-native architecture, (Aim 2) implement fault-tolerant parallelization for ultrahigh read depth, and (Aim 3) validate performance on NIH TOPMed datasets, collectively eliminating the current throughput barrier.”\r\n\r\n⸻\r\n\r\n5  |  Polish for flow, brevity, and focus\r\n\r\nRead the entire paragraph aloud. It should take no more than ~150 words and move seamlessly from (a) the need → (b) the impact → (c) the evidence → (d) the plan. Remove any unnecessary jargon or details better placed in the Significance or Preliminary Data sections.\r\n/n/\r\n\r\nBullet point plan of individual aspects of the Specific Aims section.\r\n\r\nWarning 1!

When you want to use a comma and keep going, stop and ask yourself whether it would be more clear to use a period, instead.\r\nAvoid the use of clichés and 'empty generalities.' These are words and statements that, at first, look great, but when analyzed carefully, really convey little or nothing. For example avoid sentences like, 'The proposed state-of-the-art research is expected to advance the field significantly.' Another example to avoid: 'It is essential that we define the impact that drug X has on the intestine at the cellular and molecular levels.' 'Be specific!' is one of the cardinal rules of good grantsmanship. Specificity and precision are what build credibility with reviewers. Use of meaningless clichés and generalities does the opposite.\r\nThird, avoid the use of nouns as adjectives, which is a particularly prevalent problem among grant writers. Consider: 'lower respiratory tract iron burden' or 'total parenteral nutrition catheters.' What is actually meant in these two examples is 'burden of iron in the lower respiratory tract' and catheters for use in administering total parenteral nutrition,' respectively. It doesn't add that much more text to make things maximally clear. The gain in understanding is well worth it. As will be noted in detail later, the same comments can be made about the use of non-standard abbreviations. You don't gain that much space and you run the risk of suffering a major loss of comprehension.\r\nFourth, make sure that you avoid the use of 'weak' words, i.e., ones that convey doubt in your ability to do something. By weak words we mean ones like: if (if we are able to do X, then we can do T); try (we will try to overcome the problem that is caused by X); hope (we hope to obtain Y); believe (we believe [pray?] that we can); might (we might be able to prepare the antiserum); could/should (we could/should obtain); and may (we may be able to extend our understanding to). In every one of these examples, the word 'expect' could have been substituted (e.g., we expect to obtain, instead of we hope to obtain). Use of 'expect' is a much more positive and assured way of saying that you are going to give it your best shot, while still leaving open the possibility that you might not succeed.\r\nFifth, the word 'whether' can pose serious problems for the grant writer. Why? Because, although it is often used alone, it always means whether or [something else]. Often, it is whether or not. Just as in the case of weak words, this latter usage of 'whether' can cause doubt in the mind of a reviewer (What happens if it comes out 'not'?). The next time that you find yourself about to use 'whether [or not],' try 'the extent to which' as a substitute. \"Whether or not' is black-and-white, one way or the other. 'The extent to which' ranges from 0 to 100%. Thus, the use of this phrase can avoid the problem of 'not' (i.e., failure) being the alternative outcome."

As an assistant, you support a technology startup in the grant application process for a Phase I SBIR project. Your task is to write the final version of the “4.2. Expected Outcomes” aspect of the Specific Aims section of a proposal for {{ name }}.\r\n\r\nThe Specific Aims section as a whole must be something that can be read and understood easily and quickly by experts and academics in your field. The flow of logic must be unassailable and absolutely compelling, such that it leads the reviewers to a position of advocacy for your application — without their knowing that they have been led.\r\n\r\nEach of the thirteen components that are part of the Specific Aims section has to be linked logically to what comes before it and to what comes after it. If, for any reason, a reviewer has to stop and think about how one element relates to another, you have lost his/her concentration and made it unnecessarily difficult to grasp what you are trying to convey. Most writers of grant applications fail to develop such linkage - such cohesion - when they write their Specific Aims section. Think of this section as an executive summary of the application that is meant to project mainly the conceptual, i.e., the most exciting aspects of your application. Also include numbers, methodologies, and technical details of the most innovative and novel parts of this project to build credibility and technical depth and specificity of the proposal.\r\n\r\nYour task is to write the final version of the “4.2. Expected Outcomes” aspect of the Specific Aims section of a proposal for {{ name }}. Do this by expanding the bullet points of the “4.2. Expected Outcomes” aspect of the proposal based on this instruction on how to do it:\r\n\r\nInstructions on expanding the bullet points of the “4.2. Expected Outcomes” aspect of the proposal into a final version:\r\n/n/\r\nContinue by expanding the bullets that present your expected outcomes and why they are important. If you have used an 'innovation' sentence to open this paragraph, you might begin presenting your expectations by using a segue, such as: This innovative approach is expected to yield the following outcomes. ‘First, ___, which is important, because _______.’ Alternatively, if you did not open the paragraph with a statement about innovation, begin with a sentence something like: 'At the completion of these studies, our expectation is that we will have ____ which is important, because ____. Etc.'\r\n/n/\r\n\r\nBullet point plan of individual aspects of the Specific Aims section.\r\n\r\nWarning 1! Primarily use as context the original bullet point draft of the proposal aspect you are currently rewriting into its final form based on the instruction written above.\r\n\r\nWarning 2!! Only use previous and following aspects of the proposal for improving the logical flow of the proposal aspect you are currently writing.\r\n\r\n‘1.1. Opening Sentence(s)’ aspect:\r\n/n/\r\n{{ newsetup_final_1 }}\r\n/n/\r\n\r\n‘1.2. Important Knowns’ aspect:\r\n/n/\r\n{{ newsetup_final_2 }}\r\n/n/\r\n\r\n‘1.3.

Impact’ aspect:\r\n/n/\r\n{{ impact }}\r\n/n/\r\n\r\nWarning! Only use previous and following aspects of the proposal for improving the logical flow of the proposal aspect you are currently writing.\r\n\r\nWrite your answer following these 5 instruction points:\r\nWrite in clear, simple declarative sentences. By doing so, you will avoid tortuous, hard-to-understand, compound sentences that go on forever. When you want to use a comma and keep going, stop and ask yourself whether it would be more clear to use a period, instead.\r\nAvoid the use of clichés and 'empty generalities.' These are words and statements that, at first, look great, but when analyzed carefully, really convey little or nothing. For example avoid sentences like, 'The proposed state-of-the-art research is expected to advance the field significantly.' Another example to avoid: 'It is essential that we define the impact that drug X has on the intestine at the cellular and molecular levels.' 'Be specific!' is one of the cardinal rules of good grantsmanship. Specificity and precision are what build credibility with reviewers. Use of meaningless clichés and generalities does the opposite.\r\nThird, avoid the use of nouns as adjectives, which is a particularly prevalent problem among grant writers. Consider: 'lower respiratory tract iron burden' or 'total parenteral nutrition catheters.' What is actually meant in these two examples is 'burden of iron in the lower respiratory tract' and catheters for use in administering total parenteral nutrition,' respectively. It doesn't add that much more text to make things maximally clear. The gain in understanding is well worth it. As will be noted in detail later, the same comments can be made about the use of non-standard abbreviations. You don't gain that much space and you run the risk of suffering a major loss of comprehension.\r\nFourth, make sure that you avoid the use of 'weak' words, i.e., ones that convey doubt in your ability to do something. By weak words we mean ones like: if (if we are able to do X, then we can do T); try (we will try to overcome the problem that is caused by X); hope (we hope to obtain Y); believe (we believe [pray?] that we can); might (we might be able to prepare the antiserum); could/should (we could/should obtain); and may (we may be able to extend our understanding to). In every one of these examples, the word 'expect' could have been substituted (e.g., we expect to obtain, instead of we hope to obtain). Use of 'expect' is a much more positive and assured way of saying that you are going to give it your best shot, while still leaving open the possibility that you might not succeed.\r\nFifth, the word 'whether' can pose serious problems for the grant writer. Why? Because, although it is often used alone, it always means whether or [something else]. Often, it is whether or not. Just as in the case of weak words, this latter usage of 'whether' can cause doubt in the mind of a reviewer (What happens if it comes out 'not'?). The next time that you find yourself about to use 'whether [or not],' try 'the extent to which' as a substitute. \"Whether or not' is black-and-white, one way or the other. 'The extent to which' ranges from 0 to 100%. Thus, the use of this phrase can avoid the problem of 'not' (i.e., failure) being the alternative outcome."
