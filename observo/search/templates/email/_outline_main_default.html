                <p>Thanks for reaching out through our website! As requested please find attached the 1-pagers of grant projects we can submit for the solicitations you’ve selected. At OpenGrant, we help entrepreneurs win R&D grants ($250,000 - $1,400,000) at a 3x higher success rate than industry standard, and we’re excited to help you fund your next R&D activities.</p>

                {% if grants %}
                    We have prepared for you the outlines for the following requested grants (attached below):
                    {% include "email/_grants_list.html" %}
                {% endif %}

                <p>Here's how we can help:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Identify the right grant opportunities for your project.</li>
                    <li>Write and submit your Project white paper (10 pages of R&D plans).</li>
                    <li>Prepare and submit the Full Proposal (50–60 pages) and handle all compliance requirements.</li>
                    <li>Provide a designated grant expert to guide you through the entire process until you receive the funding (including resubmission support).</li>
                </ul>

                <p>All of this is covered by a one time retainer fee of $1049 and 3% success fee (only paid if we win the grant for you). No hidden costs.</p>

                <p>How about a 20-minute meeting to discuss your Project specifics in one of these slots?</p>
