                <p>Thanks for contacting us through our website! Attached are example grant project outlines for the grant programs you selected on our website. OpenGrant helps entrepreneurs secure R&D grants ($250K–$1.4M) at three times the industry success rate; we look forward to supporting your next R&D initiative.</p>

                {% if grants %}
                    We have prepared for you the outlines of example projects (based on the limited information provided by you) for the following requested grants:
                    {% include "email/_grants_list.html" %}
                {% endif %}

                <p>Here's how we can help:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Identify the right grant opportunities for your project.</li>
                    <li>Write and submit your Project white paper (10 pages of R&D plans).</li>
                    <li>Prepare and submit the Full Proposal (50–60 pages) and handle all compliance requirements.</li>
                    <li>Provide a designated grant expert to guide you through the entire process until you receive the funding (including resubmission support).</li>
                </ul>

                <p>All of this is covered by a one time retainer fee of $1049 and 3% success fee (only paid if we win the grant for you). No hidden costs.</p>

                <p>How about a 20-minute meeting to discuss your Project specifics in one of these slots?</p>
